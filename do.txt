We are applying adobe fund for AssistiveCards and projects around it. (Leeloo, Huni)
With assistivecards we want to make the process of designing and making multilingual assistive apps and learning games very easy with the structure we call "Assistive Card".


They sound like they want to know about the team, this type of funds value people over projects or ideas, so probably highlighing the team and their talents would be a great plus.

About team that would work on assistivecards;
- Hannah <3 (hannahmilan.carrd.co)
- Burak (buraktokak.com)
My focus is currently shifting a little bit to other things, but I will always try my best, additionally I have a maker friend that showed interest in this project and might want to be a part of it, called Ebru
- Ebru (ebrukaya.me)


Additionally putting Leeloo more weight and sharing the current growth stats might be really positive, showing that an app that uses assistivecards even before assistivecards.com released is succeedign would be cool.
